The challenges across FinOps, SecOps, and CloudOps are substantial and can become a serious risk if left unmitigated. Most “solutions” being utilized (for example, home-grown tools or spreadsheets and manual processes) simply fail to address these challenges.\nSecOps Challenges\n Unified Visibility\n Lack of visibility into security threats, attacks and vulnerability data Inability to view security posture across multiple clouds  Remediation Suggestions\n Inability to remediate security violations Slowed response time due to manual follow-ups  Compliance Assessment\n Inability to assess cloud infrastructure against industry standards, regulations and best practices such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, NIST, ISO, AWS WAF etc.   FinOps Challenges\n Cost Visibility and Reports\n Inability to view cost details for projects, clouds, accounts, region, environment and resources Inability to understand cost drivers, cost insights and cost anomalies  Cost Allocation, Optimization\n Lack of resource consistency and accountability Inability to charge to appropriate cost centers   CloudOps Challenges\n Autonomous Monitoring\n Lack of autonomous monitoring affecting service availability and fault tolerance Missed SLAs due to inability to act expeditiously Lack of insights into anomalies  Infrastructure Fulfillment\n Inability to provision resources with ease Inability to execute post-provisioning activities  Incident Ticketing Workflow\n Lack of 3rd party tool integrations for incident management Inability to route incidents to ITSM tools such as ServiceNow seamlessly   "
