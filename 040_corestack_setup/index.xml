      <description>Pre-Onboarding (Prepare your Cloud Accounts) ​ You will need to set up the right access permissions to your cloud accounts for CoreStack. ​
For AWS accounts, you will need to create an IAM Role for CoreStack, with necessary access permissions based on your preference for Assessment-Only or Assessment + Governance to be performed for that account. (https://corestack-cfn.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_Create_IAM_Role_For_CorestackAssessmentandGovernance_content.json)​
CoreStack provides ready-made templates that can be used for this purpose which have appropriate access permissions built-in as part of the templates.</description>
