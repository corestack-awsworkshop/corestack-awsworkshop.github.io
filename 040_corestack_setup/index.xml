      <description>Pre-Onboarding (Prepare your Cloud Accounts) ​ You will need to set up the right access permissions to your cloud accounts for CoreStack. ​
For AWS accounts, you will need to create an IAM Role for CoreStack, with necessary access permissions based on your preference for Assessment-Only or Assessment + Governance to be performed for that account. (corestack-cfn.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_Create_IAM_Role_With_Corestack_Policies_content.json)​
CoreStack provides ready-made templates that can be used for this purpose which have appropriate access permissions built-in as part of the templates.</description>

      <description>On-boarding (Add your Cloud Accounts to CoreStack) ​ It only takes about five minutes to on-board your cloud account into CoreStack, provided the pre-requisites are taken care of.
You can follow the simple guided workflow for the onboarding process in CoreStack. Please ensure to keep handy the relevant info such as the IAM Role, App ID, Secret Key etc. when you onboard the accounts. ​ ​
From the Account Governance Dashboard, click on “Add New” and get started.</description>

      <description>Post-Onboarding (Validate your Cloud Accounts &amp;amp; Configurations) Once you have completed adding your cloud accounts into CoreStack, you can see them listed as part of the Account Summary Dashboard. As a next step, you can validate if the account has been set up correctly for all five Cloud Governance Pillars (OSCAR). ​ ​
From the Account Governance Dashboard, select the cloud account you want to review, and click on “View Settings” to see if all the access permissions are available and if there are any errors.</description>
